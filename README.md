William Osborne Brigstocke Papers Repository Project

2024 is the centennial anniversary of the publication of _Michael Neo
Paleologus: His Grammar_, the pseudonymous work on philosophy of
language (and more generally) by William Osborne Brigstocke, writing
under the nom de plume Stephen N. Palaeologus. This book forms the
nucleus of the WOB Papers Repository, itself the core of the larger
Grammar Project, to be progressively developed over the course of this
year.
